# PeepingJack
A simply program to find active jackbox.tv game codes

# How does this work?
It uses a threadpool to loop through all possible codes in a random order,
and prints the valid ones to the console

# Future plans
Probably adding a proper GUI

# Installation
1. Install python, https://python.org/downloads

2. Install dependencies
Run ``pip install futures itertools requests``

3. Download repository and unzip into a folder

4. Enter that folder in the console
``cd path/to/folder``

6. Run ``python3 main.py``, and 
if that doesn't work, try ``python main.py``
